        <p>
        Eliminating gluten means avoiding wheat, barley, rye, and other gluten-containing grains and foods made from them.
        </p>

        <h1>Ketogenic</h1>
        <p>The keto diet is based more on the ratio of fat, protein, and carbs in the diet rather than specific ingredients. Generally speaking, high fat, protein-rich foods are acceptable and high carbohydrate foods are not. The formula we use is 55-80% fat content, 15-35% protein content, and under 10% of carbohydrates.</p>
